Teknotherm SCADA Challenge – Water System Replica

Name: AZWIN MUHAMMED KK 

Teknotherm SCADA Dashboard Replica:
A high-fidelity web-based replica of the Teknotherm HVAC Automation System, built using React, Vite, and OpenBridge Web Components. This project was developed as part of a technical challenge to demonstrate proficiency in UI/UX replication, industrial component design, and real-time state management.

Technical Stack:
Framework: React.js

Build Tool: Vite

UI Standards: OpenBridge (Maritime/Industrial Design System)

Graphics: Custom SVG-based Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID)

Deployment: Netlify

Features:
Global Piping Logic: A unified SVG layer that connects components across multiple cards, simulating a continuous industrial flow.

Responsive Scaling: The dashboard uses a transform: scale() hook to ensure the complex engineering diagram fits perfectly on any screen size without breaking the layout.

Dynamic Simulation: Integrated useEffect hooks to simulate real-time sensor data, including Seawater and Outdoor temperature fluctuations.

Industrial Components: Custom-built React components for:

Plate Heat Exchangers (HE)

3-Way Mixing Valves

Centrifugal Pumps with status indicators

High-visibility Sensor Tags
